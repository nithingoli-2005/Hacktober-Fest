# Hacktober-Fest
Hacktoberfest Workshop Overview

Hacktoberfest is an annual, month-long event (October) organized by DigitalOcean, in collaboration with GitHub and other partners, aimed at encouraging developers of all skill levels to contribute to open-source projects.

The Hacktoberfest workshop is a hands-on session where participants learn how to contribute to open-source repositories, understand version control with Git and GitHub, and build real-world coding experience.

Tips on finding beginner-friendly issues in projects tagged with good-first-issue.
